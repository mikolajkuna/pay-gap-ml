### Author: Mikołaj Kuna

## Overview
This repository contains code for analyzing **gender pay gaps** using machine learning.  
It includes multiple models, such as **Linear Regression, Ridge, Random Forest, Bayesian Ridge, XGBoost, BART, and TabPFN**, and provides counterfactual analysis of pay differences.  

## Features
- Training and evaluation of various ML models for salary prediction
- Estimation of counterfactual gender pay gaps
- SHAP-based feature explainability
- Clean, modular code for reproducible analysis

## Project Structure
- `src/` – preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, predictions  
- `data/` – raw, interim, and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` – exploratory analysis and visualization  
- `models/` – saved trained models  
- `reports/figures/` – plots and visualizations of results
